        <h5>Oddity Creation Guide</h5>
        <p>
          Oddities are character traits that can be chosen by players at character creation or given by 
          Game Masters during play as situations arise. Oddities define things like which hand the character 
          is dominant in using for a particular task, and how curious or adventurois the character is.
        Each oddity has a positive and negative variant, and each variant can have an extreme and a moderate
        version. Generally each Oddity will have a name and a sub-name to determine the severity. Each
        Oddity will also have an associated point cost and modifier value or values. In the case there is a
        variant shown with a cost of 0 this is the assumed variant if none is taken specifically. In some rare
        cases the positive and negative modifier are determined by situational circumstances and the oddity
        will only have one variation. In these rare cases the point cost will never be 0.
        </p>

        Handedness The handedness of a character can influence his or her ability to perform tasks in the

        described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent, and depicts a personal
