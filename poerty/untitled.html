      <p>Untitled by Robert Kroker</p>
      <p>In this world where we value the emotionally charged deluge of stories filled with suffering,<br>
        We fear the loss And the guilt of not doing enough.<br>
        hope, not fear should prevail here.<br> 
        for the cure lives in the former though the latter is most clear. <br>
        <br>Pain from a distance, when we can. <br>
        Control what we choose to feel, it's the easiest way to deal with loss<br> 
        when we forget to give hope to those who need it to feel.<br>
        <br>I live today for the moment,<br> 
        and the people, and the joy of helping others<br>
        to crawl out of despair. <br>
        If you want to help someone, ask first, if they care <br>
        then in their darkness <br>
        for them, be there<br>
        <br>Turn around and see all the lives<br>
        near me who need to be heard,<br>
        who hope to be seen and tell them<br> 
        "I love you" and "You're worth it to me."<br>
        Hold on to a hand longer than<br>
        you should. Stress the point that<br>
        there is hope for this world<br>
        not just this day. Not just<br>
        one time, but every moment<br>
        of your life think of all the<br>
        lives your love can save.</p>
