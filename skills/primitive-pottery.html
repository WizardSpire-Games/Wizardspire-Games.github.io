    Pottery has been around longer than the written word. Pottery is the product 
    and process of forming clay and firing it at high tremperature to give objects a 
    hard durable crystaline structure. The Firing process basically turns mud into stone.

    Pottery is one of the oldest human inventions, originating before the Neolithic 
    period, with ceramic objects such as the Gravettian culture Venus of Dolní Věstonice 
    figurine discovered in the Czech Republic dating back to 29,000–25,000 BC.[3] 
    However, the earliest known pottery vessels were discovered in Jiangxi, China, which 
    date back to 18,000 BC. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery">Wikipedia - Pottery</a>

    So what? If the ancients could create pottery without all the fancy modern 
    technology, we too can learn this process and make our own pottery from scratch. 
    Now that's a funny term... where does clay come from? In the modern day most people
    get their clay from a store. However, if you want to source your own clay from the world 
    around you you will only need to go outside and look down at your feet. At any given 
    moment you are likely standing on top of some clay since it comes from dirt. Some 
    dirt has more clay than other dirt, but there is clay just about everywhere. 
    Officially clay is just sedement with particles less than 0.00016" so it's really 
    tiny dirt. I would suggest checking out Andy Ward's Ancient Pottery channel on YouTube 
    for his video <a href="https://youtu.be/ca20JkKFAcE">How To Make Clay At Home (It's Just Dirt)</a> 
    as this subject is beyond the scope of this project. Here we just want to burn it. On that note, 
    we also won't be talking about working or shaping your pottery either, for that go get some clay 
    and play with it. Just make anything. You don't want to practice firing with your masterpiece so 
    we just need something simple. Tiles with simple pressed designs are a good start.

    What the heck am I doing? Making a wild pottery kiln. The basic idea is to heat up the pottery 
    pieces with fire. So we will need something to burn. Seasoned hardwood, or lump charcoal is best but if all 
    we have is generic pressed briquettes that will work too. Now we need something to burn it in, like a pit 
    in the ground. we want to dig deep enough to remove all the grass in about a 3 foot (1 meter) diameter 
    circle. then dig down about 1 foot letting the sides slope in at approximately 45%. Next we want to create 
    an insulation layer between the ground and the pottery. some old broken pottery, ceramic plates, bricks, or 
    flat stones will work to lay in the bottom of the pit. Now we can build a ring of wood around the perimeter 
    leaving a space in the middle large enough for our work pieces. gently place our work pieces in the center
    and carefully fill the circle with twigs and paper to make it easy to light the fire. finally we will need 
    something to keep the heat in, some old rusty sheet metal will do. We need enough to cover most of the fire
    leaving a hole in the middle for the smoke to come out. Burning time! light the fire, wait until the wood 
    or charcoals have gray ash on their tips and place the metal heat shield on the fire. remember to leave a 
    hole in the middle for the smoke to escape. Note: if you are using Charcoal you should not see much smoke, 
    this is a good option if you live in a poulated area.
