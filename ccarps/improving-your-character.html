Improving Your Character</p>
<p>
Points are earned through adventuring. As a general
rule, each player should earn an average of
between 10-15 points per session that they actively
roleplay. Commonly points can be earned by: performing
an action that directly furthers the plot;
rolling a Critical Success on a plot-related action;
performing an action that helps the group at great
risk to self; remaining in character when there is
a great pressure to break the fourth wall, etc. It
is up to the Game Master, how many points each
character receives, and when. Character teams
that work together to deliberately coordinate their
actions to further the plot (without having hints
given by the Game Master) generally obtain more
points than ones that are always squabbling.</p>
