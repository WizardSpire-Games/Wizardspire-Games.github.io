Point Assignment</p>
<p>
Points must be assigned within the session they
are given; points cannot be stored up. At the
beginning of any session where a character has
unassigned points, those points must be assigned
to a Skill or into an Attribute accumulator before
play begins.</p>
<p>
Once points are assigned to a skill they may not
be moved or re-assigned. Skills are increased
by adding points to them. Modifier bonuses are
gained according to the Modifier Table (see Modifier
Table ). The maximum points a Skill can have
is 36. New Skills can be learned through a trainer,
reading the appropriate book, or similar learning
adventures. Even when learning a new Skill this
way, one must use the points given during that
session. </p>
<p>For example:
Bob the Bouncer wants to add a combat skill to
gain a block/parry advantage for when he has to
confront unruly people. At the end of the session,
Bob has earned 3 points; he either locates
a trainer or self-teaches by reading a book. The
player writes the skill name into the skill list, applies
all three points he has earned to the new
Skill, locates and records the modifier and dice
for a skill with 3 points.</p>
      <p>Combat</p>
<p>Combat is
represented as a series of actions. All actions are
rosolved throught skill tests. Each action has a
base Target Number that is determined by a difficulty
table. The base target number is modified
by the Game Master for Sutuational Difficulty,
the active Player for Character Skill Modifiers,
and the opponent for Defensive Skill Modifiers.</p>
<p>
• Situational modifiers can be positive or negative
depending on the current conditions.</p>
<p>
• Active Skill modifiers are always positive.</p>
<p>
• Defensive Skill modifiers are always negative.</p>
<p>
The combat sequence is as follows:</p>
<p>
• Active Character Initiates combat by describing
their intended action.</p>
<p>
• Game Master determines the base target
number and applies the situational modifiers.</p>
<p>
• Opposing Character subtracts his or her reflex
modifier and defencive skill modifiers.</p>
<p>
• Active Character makes a skill test and subtracts
his or her skill modifiers and weapon</p>
<p>
attack Modifiers.</p>
<p>
• Upon success, the Active Character sums the
weapon damage and any damage Modifiers.</p>
<p>
• Active Character reports the number and
damage type to the Opposing Character.</p>
<p>
• The Opposing Character subtracts their appropriate
resistances from the damage.</p>
<p>
• The Opposing Character records the damage
in the related damage type box.</p>
<p>
If the damage is below one, no marking is done.
See Damage Overload below if damage exceeds the
number of available boxes.</p>
<p>
If the attack roll was a Critical Success the final
damage staging number is doubled. Critical Failure
may result in the attackar harming self or any
friend nearby (at Game Master’s discretion).</p>
