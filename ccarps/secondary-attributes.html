Secondary Attributes</p>
<p>
The secondary attributes are average combinations
of the primary attributes. Once the secondary
attribute base is calculated use the skill
modifier table to determine the secondary attribute
modifier. Skills are based on secondary
attributes as are any action rolls where a character
does not have a related skill.</p>
<p>
Unskilled Action Rule Unskilled action rolls
always use 2d, are limited to simple actions, are
immune to critical success and failure, and are
subject to all situational modifiers. Characters
may not use the unskilled action rule to perform
complex actions. A Complex Action is any action
that is composed of two or more simple actions.
Complex Action example: firing an arrow from
a bow; knock an arrow, draw, aim, and release.
This would require 4 separate dice rolls under the
unskilled action rule, one for each of the simple
actions. To successfully fire the arrow, the character
would have to succeed on all of the rolls in
succession for the simple action steps to complete
the complex action required to fire a bow. A failed
roll would cause the character to start the whole
process over from the beginning.</p>
<p>
• Charisma (CHA): Personal charm or magnetism,
as determined by the health, and will
of the character. Average of Willpower and
Constitution. (W + C) / 2</p>

action. Average of Strength and Dexterity.
(S + D) / 2</p>

Average of Dexterity, and Intelligence.

Strength. (C + S) / 2</p>

of something; to be aware of. Average of
Intelligence and Willpower. (I + W) / 2</p>
