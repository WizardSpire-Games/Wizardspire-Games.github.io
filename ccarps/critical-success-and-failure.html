        A Critical Success happens when all dice in a roll set are 1. The more dice you roll, the more often your character 
        will succeed, but the harder it will be for your character to get a Critical Success. A Critical Success means the 
        action succeeds and has a better than expected result. The more dice in a set, the more amazing a critical will be.
        The Game Master has the honor of determining what “amazing” looks like, and what events will be triggered because 
        of a critical success. Conversely, a Critical Failure happens when all dice in a roll set are 6. When you roll more 
        dice your character will fail less often; therefore, it will become less likely that your character will critically 
        fail. A Critical Failure has worse than expected results. The more dice in a rolled set, the more dangerous the 
        Critical Fail will be. The Game Master has the misfortune of determining what “danger” will befall the player group, 
        and what events will be triggered because of a critical fail.
