Skills</p>
<p>
Skills determine what your character can do as
well as what they know. Adding one point to a
skill is the equivalent of the character experimenting
with new ideas, or reading a basic instruction
manual, or taking an introductory lesson from
one who knows the skill at an advanced level or
higher. This gives the character the ability to use
the skill to perform a complex action with a single
die roll.</p>
<p> Using a skill to perform a Complex Action.
example: firing an arrow from a bow; knock
an arrow, draw, aim, and release. one point in
Archery skill would alow the character to make
one roll to determine the result of the four simple
acctions required to fire an arrow.</p>
<p>
/// Each skill has an Attribute associated with it.
These attributes are skill requirements; at character
creation no skill may have points that are
greater than the associated attribute modifier.
For example, if your Charisma Modifier is +2,
you cannot have more than 2 points in your Intimidate
skill at character creation.///
Before a character can attempt to use a skill they
must apply at least one point to it for it to be
useful. To use a skill without any proficiency see
Unskilled Action rule under Secondary Attribute
section.</p>
