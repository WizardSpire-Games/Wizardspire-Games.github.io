        CCARPS exclusively uses six-sided dice. Dice rolls are indicated by appending a “d” after the number 
        of dice; “4d” means “four six-sided dice.” 
      </p>
      <p>
        CCARPS uses between one and five six-sided dice to make tests and checks, the goal of rolling is to 
        get the lowest possible roll (ones are good). Players roll a number of dice according to their 
        skill level for the given test taking the two lowest dice and adding their values, in the case 
        of all rolled dice coming up on 1 that constitutes a critical success, whereas all 6's would be 
        a critical failure. In the case of an unskilled test, a player only rolls one die and counts a 6 
        on the other. What if a player rolls a contested check and there is a tie? in this case the Degree 
        of success is calculated using the remaining dice, if the tie persists the contest goes to the defender.
        (defended is the character responding to a skill test.)
