        CCARPS exclusively uses six-sided dice. Dice rolls are indicated by appending a “d” after the number 
        of dice; “4d” means “four six-sided dice.” Each player will utilize between two and five dice in an 
        attempt to roll as low as possible. The number of dice a player rolls is determined by the character’s 
        skill dice for an applicable skill.
