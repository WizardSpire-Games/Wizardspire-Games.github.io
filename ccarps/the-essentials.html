      <p>CCARPS (Community Codex, RolePlay System) is a set of rules created to provide structure and mechanics to breathe life into the imagined worlds of a roleplay game.</p>
        <p>Roleplay: the act of pretending within a given set of rules to play a game and tell a story.</p>
        <p>Player: a person in a Roleplay game group who takes control of one or more characters and works to further the story.</p>
        <p>Character: one of the people in the game that players "use" to shape the story.</p>
        <p>Non-Player Character: A character in the game that is part of the story but not one of the heros.</p>
        <p>Game Master: The player who has chosen the role of guiding the narrative and "playing" all the Non-Player Characters.</p>
        <p>Game World: an imaginary world where the characters live, work, play, and die. Where the story takes place.</p>
        <p>Dice: a 6 sided cube used to make all complicated skill tests and ability checks.</p>
