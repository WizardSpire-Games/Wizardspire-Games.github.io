Character Appearance</p>
<p>
The appearance of a given character is generally
up to the player. However, it is a good idea to
use character Attributes, Oddities, and Skills as
guidelines. The range of possible values in a base
Attribute is 5 to 30 for an adult character (21 years
or older). Just as a person with an Intelligence of
5 would be seen as an imbecile, a person with 5 in
Charisma would be a rather unlikeable fellow. It
would be unusual for a character who is perceived
to be strong to have low Strength. It should be
noted that CCARPS characters range the average
Human height: from 4 feet 6 inches to 7 feet. Any
other heights are up to the Game Master.</p>
