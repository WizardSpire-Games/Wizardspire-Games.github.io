Damage</p>
<p>
The damage system is based on the ancient
Greek’s beliefs regarding human existence, where
a person was measured by the strength and health
of their mind, body, and spirit. The optimal case
would be to have all three in equal amounts such
that they could be represented by an equilateral
triangle: Mental -> Physical -> Spiritual ->
Mental. Dealing and taking damage is handled
through a series of check boxes. There are ten
boxes for each of the three types of health. Damage
is counted by checking a number of boxes
equal to the amount of damage dealt starting at
the damage level noted by the weapon’s damage
type and rating, and all boxes below that level.
If a character has already taken damage beyond
the indicated level, the new damage is counted by
checking off boxes on the next available damage
type until all the damage is applied. Damage
levels are Light, Moderate, Heavy, and Deadly.
In CCARPS damage comes in three forms; Mental,
Physical, and Spiritual.</p>
<p>
Damage is represented as a series of three connected
bars of ten boxes each. Box ten on the
Mental bar is connected to box one on the Physical
bar, and box ten on the Physical bar is connected
to box one on the Spiritual bar. The tenth box of
Spiritual is connected to box one of the Mental
bar.</p>
<p>
Damage overload occurs when the normal damage
bar for the given damage index is full, and
more damage of the same type is dealt to a character.
The overload damage is then applied to
the next damage meter. When a character fills
an entire damage bar, that character will lose
consciousness.</p>
<p>
Once a character is unconscious, the player must
roll 2d against their Charisma Modifier as their
Basic Target Number. On a failure, the character
takes 1 point of damage, following the order of
damage overload. A character is permanently
dead when all three bars are filled completely.
Any character that has two bars of damage filled,
they cannot be revived without intervention of a
trauma surgeon (or other world and/or campaignspecific
skills).</p>
<p>
Damage types include Stun, Shock, Bludgeon,
Cutting, Piercing, and Energy (some worlds call
this “magic”).</p>
