        There is only one dice-roll mechanic in CCARPS: a base Target Number is assigned, all modifiers are 
        applied to the base Target Number, and dice are rolled in an attempt to roll lower than the Modified 
        Target Number. This is achieved by using the two lowest dice in any dice roll set. This applies to all 
        rolls made by a Player, or Game Master. The Game Master makes rolls for game environment conditions, 
        and all NPCs in an encounter. A Target Number is the base difficulty for performing an action under the 
        current situational conditions. Modifiers do not affect dice rolls only target numbers. All modifiers from
        weapons, armor, and skills must be accounted for and the target number adjusted before the player rolls any 
        dice for the given action.

        Your character is sneaking around (base target number 3) in a dark (situational modifier +1) and unfamiliar 
        place (situational modifier -2). Your character has a “Stealth” skill with a modifier of 3 and quiet shoes 
        with a Modifier of 1. The base Target Number to sneak undetected is a 3 the Game Master will add in the 
        situational modifiers +1 for dark -2 for unfamiliar and call out a Simple Target Number of 2. You add your 
        character’s modifiers, Stealth 3 and Quiet Shoes 1 to the Simple Target Number 2 for Skilled Target Number
        of 6; you must roll under a 6. Your novice level for Stealth gives you 3 dice. you roll 3d and get a 3, 2, 
        and 4. Adding up the two lowest dice, the result is 5. Your character is successfully stealthy. A patrolman 
        walks nearby, which contests your active “Stealth” skill. The Simple Target Number is equal to your success 
        roll of 5. The patrolman has a “Detect” skill modifier of 3, which makes the Modified Target Number an 8. 
        You call out your defensive action and make your character stop moving to push the target number down by 1 
        making the Opposed Target Number a 7. The Game Master rolls 3d for the patrolman and gets a 5, 6 and a 2. 
        Remembering that the lowest two dice are the only ones that matter, they are added (2 + 5) for a total of 7. 
        The patrolman fails to detect your character as he walks by and moves out of sight.

        <li>• Skilled Target Number: Simple Target Number + your character’s applicable Modifiers</li>
