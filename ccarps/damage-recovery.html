Damage Recovery</p>
<p>
Mental Health heals over time;</p>
<p>
Physical Health heals with medical attention; </p>
<p>
Spiritual Health requires an act of faith, affirmation, or some other
type of belief, to heal.</p>
<p>
Mental Health recovery time is equal to 10 minutes
times the number of damage boxes checked
in all three damage indicators. A character with
5 boxes of Mental, 2 box of Physical, and 1 box of
Spiritual, marked. 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. 8 * 10 minutes
= 80 minutes. After that time, or whenever the
Game Master says (in the event they speed time
up), all Mental Health boxes are cleared.
MH Recovery = 10 * # damage boxes filled
Physical Health can be recovered by the application
of first aid for up to 3 boxes (first aid can
only be used once for each wound, A field medic
with a standard field medical kit, can heal up to
6 boxes once for each wound. The character can
to be treated by a doctor in a hospital or medical
clinic to heal up to 10 boxes. In any case, the
recovery time is 10 hours times the initial number
of damage boxes checked in all three damage indicators,
divided by the Tech Level of the character
rendering aid.
Spiritual Health is the most difficult to regain.
Each point of Spiritual damage marked will require
a number of hours spent in the act of
meditating, praying, or otherwise feeding the
soul/spirit to heal. The amount of time is equal
to 10 hours times the number of Spiritual Health
boxes marked. The spiritual rebuilding exercise
must be coordinated through the Game Master
and must be in accordance with the characterâ€™s
stated belief system.</p>
