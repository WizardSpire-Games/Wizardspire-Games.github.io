Starting Points</p>
<p>
Every character, whether it is the Player or NPC,
has starting points. These are the points that you
will spend on Oddities and Skills. In order to be
ready for the game, the sum of the points spent
on Oddities and the character’s Skills points must
equal the sum of the Starting primary attribute
Points for your character. The ability to sum and
balance the character sheet is one feature that
lends itself to translating the CCARPS system
into other forms of media such as video games. A
character’s starting points are equal to the sum
of the character’s primary attributes.</p>
