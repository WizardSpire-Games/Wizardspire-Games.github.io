            <p>Disposition</p>
<p>
The sum of a character’s Attributes, Health, Oddities,
and Skills, is referred to as their Disposition.
A character’s Disposition is tendency to act in a
specific way. Much like the real world, a character’s
skill set, demeanor, and overall health oftentimes
shines through in their personality. This
can be said as generalizations for groups, communities,
and nations as well.</p>
<p>
• Attributes are the core of a character. They
greatly influence everything about the character.
The base Attributes are averaged into
secondary Attributes and converted into modifiers
through a personal/skill modifier table
to make Skill creation and use easier, as well
as to more accurately reflect the nature of
attributes as a complex system.</p>
<p>
• Health Meter is the sum of a character’s
Mental, Physical, and Spiritual health. The
healthiest characters have nothing checked
or marked in these boxes.</p>
<p>
• Oddities are traits that are taken at character
creation and provide a defining factor
in a character’s strengths and weaknesses,
while also providing fuel for creative roleplay.
Oddities have a permanent passive effect on
the character; they may boost skill sets, but
may come at a cost of Health detriments (or
the other way around).</p>
<p>
• Skills are learned abilities that a character
possesses. These are what a character knows
how to do.</p>
<p>Character Creation</p>
<p>It is great to sit down to play a game with well written
characters. It is even better when
the character’s attributes and abilities are reflected
in the story. Many players and game
masters take pride in designing the characters
and adventures they play, from the environment
and backstory to appearance, to
attitude and social disposition. They create
interesting characters with compelling and
intriguing lives. In these stories the characters
are center stage and the Game Master
is the guide.</p>
<p>
Disposition</p>
<p>
A character’s Disposition is the sum of their
character sheet. Oddities make up the largest
and most lasting permanent changes to a character;
they give permanent bonuses and detriments.
They are the only part of character creation that
can modify any aspect of a character, including
(especially) Attributes, Resistances, and the
Health Meter.</p>
