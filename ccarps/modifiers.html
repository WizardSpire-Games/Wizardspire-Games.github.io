        Attributes, Skills, and some Oddities have Modifiers, as will some situational details, and equipment.
        These Modifiers are used to alter a given Target Number. Situational modifiers are applied to the base 
        Target Number by the Game Master before or as the Target Number is given to the player depending on the 
        Game Master’s preference. The active character’s Modifiers increase the given Target Number. If it is a 
        contested roll, the opposing character’s Modifiers reduce the Target Number. The larger the Target Number
        becomes, the more likely the active character will succeed.
