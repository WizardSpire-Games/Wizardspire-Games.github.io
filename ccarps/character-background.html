Character Background</p>
<p>
This is pretty much open to player creativity.
Background story can go a long way toward identifying
a character’s habits of mind, body, and
spirit. This can aid the player in making good
believable decisions and greatly enhance the role
play experience as well as add to the group dynamics
so put some thought into this part. Take
this opportunity to be creative and make your
character interesting. The character’s Disposition
is a great thing to keep in mind when writing
their story. See Disposition section for more information.
Also you may want to give some thought
to the world your character exists in, this will
help you to fit in and guide you in role playing
your character.</p>
