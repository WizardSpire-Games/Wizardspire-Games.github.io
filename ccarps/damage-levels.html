Damage Levels</p>
<p>
Damage is represented by three sets of ten boxes.
Each damage type (as mentioned above) has
its own Damage Meter Bar. Damage levels are
separated into Light, Moderate, Serious, and
Deadly. When a character reaches the first box
on a given meter, that character will take a -1
penalty to all Target Numbers. At the third box
the character takes a -2 to all Target Numbers.
At the sixth box the character takes a -3 to all
target numbers.</p>
<p>
These penalties are cumulative. If a character has
registered three physical and six mental damage
the total penalty will be -1 + -2 + -3 for the
mental damage plus -1 + -2 for a total penalty of
-9. These penalties will remain until the damage
is healed below the given level.</p>
