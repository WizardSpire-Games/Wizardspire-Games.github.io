Character Creation Conventions</p>
<p>
The conventions used to roll up characters for your
adventure will influence the feel of the adventure.
Some methods are more Hard Core than others
while some are down right campy. None of the
methods you choose are necessarily bad or good
just different. CCARPS is designed to be adaptive
so that it can naturally support whatever style
you and your group wish to play. We would like
to provide some examples for you to think about,
these are not to be considered an extensive list
and by no means exhaustive.</p>
<p>
• Hard Core: this method will generally create
characters that will require many hours
to build and is not recommended for the faint
of heart. For your Hard Core roll play, roll
your dice according to your age chart and
record them in the order they are rolled directly
onto the character sheet. First roll =
Strength, second = Dexterity, third = Constitution,
fourth = Intelligence, and fifth =
Wisdom. No re-rolls; limit the number of
Oddities to five and require the sum of all
oddities to = 0; limit the maximum starting
skill points for any one skill to the associated
Attribute’s modifier.</p>
<p>
• Fantasy: this method will create characters
that are moderately easy to play. It
is a good choice if you like a serious story
Figure 3: Modifier Table but moderately challenging 
game play. For Fantasy style, roll five sets of dice according
to the Age Table, and record them on the
back of your character sheet. Assign each set
according to your preference for the type of
character you wish to play. Limit the number
of Oddities to seven and the maximum starting
skill points to two times the associated
Attribute’s modifier.</p>
<p>
• Campy: this method is a great way to play
a quick game loaded with silliness and amazingly
funny antics, but is not a good campaign
setting, as normally the rewards are
handed out liberally to support the entertainment
value for the players. For a campy
game, roll 10 sets of dice according to the
Age Table, re-rolling all ones. Record your
best five sets in any order you choose. Limit
the number of Oddities to the system maximum
of ten. There is no limit on starting
skill points.</p>
<p>
Wealth and Influence count as Oddities so they
will each take up a slot if they are taken. If they
are not taken wealth will only be used to determine
your starting currency, and Social influence
will have no effect on your character.</p>
