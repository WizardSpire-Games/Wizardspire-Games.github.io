Oddities</p>
<p>
Oddities may only be taken at character creation.
Oddities are used to gain advantages and to make
trade off’s to provide flexibility and role-play interest
in character options, in other words, Oddities
add “character” to your characters. Your Game
Master may modify a character’s Oddities based
on role-play events or extraordinary situations.
Oddities may make permanent Health changes</p>

based on the description of the oddity, or Game
Master’s discretion.</p>
<p>
The general rule with Oddities is that each Oddity
must have a balanced cost and benefit. Some
oddities have a positive effect and cost points,
while others have a negative effect and give points.
Use your best judgement when selecting oddities
for your character, but be reasonable a character
with too many oddities or conflicting oddities can
be difficult or impossible to role-play accurately.
Basic Oddities</p>
<p>
During character creation, there are two Oddities
that are reccomended. These are Wealth and
Social Influence. There are no Modifiers with
these; instead, they help give characters some
“roots” into the game world. If no Wealth or
Social Influence is taken, it is assumed they are
Middle Class with no contacts out of the ordinary.
Wealth is a measure of a character’s accumulation
of material value, including things such as
property (home, car, horses), finery (cloths, tools,
weapons), etc. and defines the character’s starting
currency according to the Wealth Table. The
points spent or given are meant to represent the
character’s perception of wealth and their ability
to move in social circles. A person raised with
a filthy rich lifestyle would stand out like a sore
thumb on skid row, just as a dirt poor person
would at a country club.</p>
  <p>
Figure 2: Wealth and Standing</p>
<p>
Social Influence is measured by the number of
people you have in your contact list, and the quality
of the contact relationship eg. An Acquaintance
(a low quality contact) will accept your call
and listen to your request, they may even provide
information if asked the right question but the
information has a 50% chance of being inaccurate.
A Friend (an average contact) is like a good
friend, you can trust them to tell you what they
know but they have limited access to high level
information, and generally will not get into harms
way for you. A Confidant (a high quality contact)
will have good access to information and be trustworthy
and reliable and will defend you at his or
her own risk up to but not including risk of his or
her own life. Conversely you can choose contacts
that are detramental to your character. eg. the
Antagonist is most often hyper competative in
all your dealings and may even enjoy seeing your
character struggle through a problem they coaxed
or goaded your character into. A Nemesis will
actively seek ways to interfere with your character
and their dealings up to but not limited to
setting you up for a major setback or even your
hapenstance death. An Arch-Nemesis is the most
dangerous type of contact the Arch-nemesis will
actively plot your character’s demise often in the
most diabolical way. At character creation your
character can take a maximum of three contacts
and your character cannot spend or receive more
than 15 points in total unless the Game Master
says otherwise.</p>
