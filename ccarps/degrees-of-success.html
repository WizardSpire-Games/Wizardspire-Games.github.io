        modifier of +1 and 2d, the Skilled Target Number is 5. You roll a 2 and a 1 for a final roll of 3. Subtract 3 from 
        5 to find Your character’s Degree of Success: 5 - 3 = 2, which is enough for your character to know that the dog is 
        happy, but has most likely lost its owner.
