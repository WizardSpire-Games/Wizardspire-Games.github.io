        There are a lot of actions that characters will take that are trivial or common sense. These do not require a roll 
        and are counted as automatically succeeding. The only time these will need a roll are when there are adverse 
        conditions (weather, battle, impeding injury, etc.) or when the Game Master says.
      </p>

        Walking in a straight line on a summer day would have no roll. Attempting to walk in a straight line on sheet ice 
        during a snow storm would require a roll to keep footing and a roll to maintain the correct direction of travel.
