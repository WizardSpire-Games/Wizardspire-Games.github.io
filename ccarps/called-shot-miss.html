<h3>Called Shot Miss</h3></p>
<p>
When a player designates an area to hit on a
target, the player must roll below the modified
target number to hit. if the player’s roll is equal
to or greater than the modified target number the
players shot will miss. As you may have guessed,
this is where Sir Issaic Newton’s first law comes
in: “An object in motion tends to stay in motion”,
etc. etc. so that thing; fist, arrow, bullet must go
somewhere. The following chart and 1d6 will help
you figure out what force will cancel the motion
of the object.</p>
<p>
Imagine a circle cut into 6 slices overlaid on the
target with its center point on the called location.
Now roll 1d and count the pie slices clockwise from
the top to determine which direction the miss
took. </p>
<p>Newton’s Second Law is “the relationship
Force equals mass times acceleration (F = m * a).
Use the difference between the Modified Target
Number and the player’s roll to determine the
magnitude. Then, let Sir Isaac prove his stuff by
knocking the F out of the projectile, and into the
unintended location. The creativity gets going
when applying Newton’s Third Law:”To every
action there is always opposed an equal reaction."</p>
