    <p>
        Community Codex Adaptive RolePlay System, often referred to as its acronym, “CCARPS”, 
        is an open source ruleset licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike. 
        This system has been developed to promote storytelling within a minimal ruleset. 
        We believe that the game should be about the characters so the rules shouldn’t get 
        in the way of the story. This is a Community Codex; players and developers alike can 
        actively participate in the shaping and refinement of this rule system. It is adaptive; 
        the base rules are meant to be a generic starting point that can support any style of 
        gameplay and world. While the main goal is roleplay, the system is built in a 
        character-centric way that can be used to power any type of gameplay that involves tracking 
        player statistics.
     </p>
     <p>
        While the rules here are complete and you can play as-is, this is just the Base Ruleset. It 
        is meant to be used alongside an existing game world and/or campaign. This means that we 
        have not included any game content within these pages.
