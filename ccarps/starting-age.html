Starting Age</p>
<p>
Starting Age is used to help add variety to the
group’s characters, where physical growth and
past experience are taken into account. A character’s
starting age adds depth and a sense of
connection between the character, their past, and
their place in the game world. The first step
in character creation is to choose the character’s
starting age. Second step is to find the character’s
starting age on the Starting Age Table to determine
how many dice to roll for each attribute.</p>

<p>
The third step is rolling your character’s Primary
Attributes. In general players roll five sets of
dice according to the Starting Age Table and
record each set in one of the primary attribute
boxes. The primary attributes each have two
boxes associated with them. The Accumulator
box, and the Points box. The Accumulator box
is used for storing adventure points during game
play and is labeled Acc. see Improving Your
Character for more information. The Points box,
labeled Pts., is used to record the initial values
for the character’s primary attributes.</p>
