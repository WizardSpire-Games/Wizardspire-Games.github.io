        The Game Master is the narrator, tour guide, and final word in all story related matters. 
        The most important job of a game master is to guide and influence the character in ways that 
        move the game story along. A good game master must be prepared, decisive and above all else 
        flexable. No matter where the Game Master wants to go with the story the players, through no 
        fault of their own, will derail the plans like a herd of stampeeding bovine crossing the great 
        trans-continental rail road.
