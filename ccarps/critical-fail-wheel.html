Critical Fail Wheel</p>
<p>
In the case of a Critical Fail, we have a Critical
Fail Wheel. The Active Character is in the
middle of the wheel (as shown below) and any
nearby characters, both friendly and enemy, will
fall within a certain number. The Active Character
rolls 2d, with the sum being the direction
in which their action went. This works for both
ranged and melee combat.</p>
