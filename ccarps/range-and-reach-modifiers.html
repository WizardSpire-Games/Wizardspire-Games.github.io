Range and Reach Modifiers</p>
<p>
Range and Reach are how far a character can
use projectiles or hit with melee weapons. Each
weapon has its own range or reach, and will have
the distance number and units listed for each section:
Short, Medium, Long, Extreme. These are
represented in the character sheet in the weapon
section as S, M, L, E.</p>
