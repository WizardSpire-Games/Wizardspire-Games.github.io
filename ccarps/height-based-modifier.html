      <p>Height-based Modifiers</p>
<p>
Height modifiers are calculated by taking the
Opposing Character’s Height (rounded) in feet
and subtracting the Active Character’s height
(rounded) in feet. For example, if the Active
Character is 7 feet tall and the Opposing Character
is 3 feet tall, the Active Character will have a -4
Modifier to hit and a +4 Modifier to damage.
However, when the Opposing Character becomes
Active, they will have a +4 Modifier to hit and
a -4 Modifier to damage. This helps prevent giant
characters from always being able to hit tiny
characters as if they were equal in height.</p>
