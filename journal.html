        <p><h2>The end of the internet.</h2></p>
        It needs to end if we are to progress as a society. <br />
        The tendancy for people to be self isolating in tribal <br />
        communities is fracturing our world more than it was <br />
        before we could shout all our impulsive thoughts into <br />
        the void from the safety of our own keyboard. Matbe AI<br />
        is our savior, and not the big scary bad technology <br />
        of destruction. If we can train it for truth and <br />
        prevent it from hulucinating or fabricating answers<br />
        it thinks we want to hear. What if we didn't have to<br />
        sit at our computer to use it? what if we could just <br />
        talk to an AI on our phone or some similar device. <br />
        I hear you all shouting "what about my data!" I <br />
        get it, really. I am thinking about a MVP AI <br />
        something local that only uses the web as <br />
        a source to lookup information. all the <br />
        processing can be done on our local <br />
        device. we get to keep our data <br />
        private. Yes I understand that <br />
        it would not be the most powerful <br />
        AI system, but do we really believe <br />
        that most of our AI work requires <br />
        a doctoral thesis to answer our <br />
        question? A basic AI could do <br />
        what we need on the average day <br />
        then when you need a deep dive into <br />
        a subject or detailed code written your <br />
        pocket AI could talk to whatever AI farm you<br />
        want. In general terms the massive power used <br />
        by the major AI servers could be reduced through <br />
        distribution over many small devices that can handle <br />
        the easy querys and we only need to use the big data <br />
        center when our question warrents it. We could even <br />
        automate our homes with a Local AI system that can <br />
        monitor and manage our systems in a middle ground <br />
        setting. More powerful than a handheld but still <br />
        more distributed than a data center. <br />
