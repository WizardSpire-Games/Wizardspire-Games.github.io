        The end of the internet.
        It needs to end if we are to progress as a society. 
        The tendancy for people to be self isolating in tribal 
        communities is fracturing our world more than it was 
        before we could shout all our impulsive thoughts into 
        the void from the safety of our own keyboard. Matbe AI
        is our savior, and not the big scary bad technology 
        of destruction. If we can train it for truth and 
        prevent it from hulucinating or fabricating answers
        it thinks we want to hear. What if we didn't have to
        sit at our computer to use it? what if we could just 
        talk to an AI on our phone or some similar device. 
        I hear you all shouting "what about my data!" I 
        get it, really. I am thinking about a MVP AI 
        something local that only uses the web as 
        a source to lookup information. all the 
        processing can be done on our local 
        device. we get to keep our data 
        private. Yes I understand that 
        it would not be the most powerful 
        AI system, but do we really believe 
        that most of our AI work requires 
        a doctoral thesis to answer our 
        question? A basic AI could do 
        what we need on the average day 
        then when you need a deep dive into 
        a subject or detailed code written your 
        pocket AI could talk to whatever AI farm you
        want. In general terms the massive power used 
        by the major AI servers could be reduced through 
        distribution over many small devices that can handle 
        the easy querys and we only need to use the big data 
        center when our question warrents it. We could even 
        automate our homes with a Local AI system that can 
        monitor and manage our systems in a middle ground 
        setting. More powerful than a handheld but still 
        more distributed than a data center.
