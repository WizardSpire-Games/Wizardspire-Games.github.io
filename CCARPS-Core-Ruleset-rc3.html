<h2 id="WIC">What is CCARPS?</h2>
<p>Community Codex Adaptive RolePlay System, often
referred to as its acronym, “CCARPS”, is an
open source ruleset licensed under Creative Commons
Attribution Share-Alike. This system has
been developed to promote storytelling within a
minimal ruleset. We believe that the game should
be about the characters so the rules shouldn’t get
in the way of the story. This is a Community
Codex; players and developers alike can actively
participate in the shaping and refinement of this
rule system. It is adaptive; the base rules are
meant to be a generic starting point that can
support any style of gameplay and world. While
the main goal is roleplay, the system is built in a
character-centric way that can be used to power
any type of gameplay that involves tracking player
statistics.</p>
<p>
While the rules here are complete and you can play
as-is, this is just the Base Ruleset. It is meant to
be used alongside an existing game world and/or
campaign. This means that we have not included
any game content within these pages.</p>
<p>
The Essentials</p>
<p>
Players</p>
<p>
Players are the main characters in a role-play
adventure story. Players drive the story through
actions and and interactions with the game story.
Every player adds value and interest to the game
and together they help write the story.</p>
<p>
Game Master</p>
<p>
The Game Master is the narrator, tour guide, and
final word in all story related matters. The most
important job of a game master is to guide and
influence the character in ways that move the
game story along. A good game master must be
prepared, decisive and above all else flexable. No
matter where the Game Master wants to go with
the story the players, through no fault of their
own, will derail the plans like a herd of stampeeding
bovine crossing the great trans-continental
rail road.</p>
<p>
Non-Player Characters
Non-Player Characters or NPCs are the creatures
and people the players interact with in the game
story. The Game Master handles all actions, contests,
and relations for all of the NPCs the Players
will encounter.</p>
<p>
Dice</p>
<p>
CCARPS exclusively uses six-sided dice. Dice
rolls are indicated by appending a “d” after the
number of dice; “4d” means “four six-sided dice.”
Each player will utilize between two and five dice
in an attempt to roll as low as possible. The
number of dice a player rolls is determined by the
character’s skill dice for an applicable skill.</p>
<p>
Target Numbers</p>
<p>
Any complex activity has an associated target
number based on the difficulty of the task and the
amount of time the character has to execute the
task. Players use a number of dice to determine
the outcome of these activities.</p>
<p>
Modifiers</p>
<p>
Attributes, Skills, and some Oddities have Modifiers,
as will some situational details, and equipment.
These Modifiers are used to alter a given
Target Number. Situational modifiers are applied
to the base Target Number by the Game Master
before or as the Target Number is given to the
player depending on the Game Master’s preference.
The active character’s Modifiers increase
the given Target Number. If it is a contested
roll, the opposing character’s Modifiers reduce the
Target Number. The larger the Target Number
becomes, the more likely the active character will
succeed.</p>
<p>
Rolling for Success</p>
<p>
There is only one dice-roll mechanic in CCARPS:
a base Target Number is assigned, all modifiers
are applied to the base Target Number, and dice
are rolled in an attempt to roll lower than the
Modified Target Number. This is achieved by using
the two lowest dice in any dice roll set. This
applies to all rolls made by a Player, or Game
<p>2</p>
Master. The Game Master makes rolls for game
environment conditions, and all NPCs in an encounter.
A Target Number is the base difficulty
for performing an action under the current situational
conditions. Modifiers do not affect dice
rolls only target numbers. All modifiers from
weapons, armor, and skills must be accounted for
and the target number adjusted before the player
rolls any dice for the given action.</p>
<p>
Your character is sneaking around (base target
number 3) in a dark (situational modifier +1) and
unfamiliar place (situational modifier -2). Your
character has a “Stealth” skill with a modifier
of 3 and quiet shoes with a Modifier of 1. The
base Target Number to sneak undetected is a 3 the
Game Master will add in the situational modifiers
+1 for dark -2 for unfamiliar and call out a Simple
Target Number of 2. You add your character’s
modifiers, Stealth 3 and Quiet Shoes 1 to the Simple
Target Number 2 for Skilled Target Number
of 6; you must roll under a 6. Your novice level
for Stealth gives you 3 dice. you roll 3d and get
a 3, 2, and 4. Adding up the two lowest dice, the
result is 5. Your character is successfully stealthy.
A patrolman walks nearby, which contests your
active “Stealth” skill. The Simple Target Number
is equal to your success roll of 5. The patrolman
has a “Detect” skill modifier of 3, which makes
the Modified Target Number an 8. You call out
your defensive action and make your character
stop moving to push the target number down by
1 making the Opposed Target Number a 7. The
Game Master rolls 3d for the patrolman and gets
a 5, 6 and a 2. Remembering that the lowest two
dice are the only ones that matter, they are added
(2 + 5) for a total of 7. The patrolman fails to
detect your character as he walks by and moves
out of sight.</p>
<p>
CCARPS has three types of Target Number modification:</p>
<p>
• Simple Target Number: Base Target Number</p>
<p>
+ situational modifiers.</p>
<p>
• Skilled Target Number: Simple Target Number</p>
<p>
+ your character’s applicable Modifiers</p>
<p>
• Opposed Target Number: Skilled Target</p>
<p>
Number - opposition’s applicable Modifiers</p>
<p>
Degrees of Success</p>
<p>
There are some situations where an Oddity or
Skill’s action will depend on the Degree of Success.
To find the Degree of Success, subtract the
successful roll from the Target Number. The difference
is the Degree of Success.</p>
<p>
Coming across a stray dog, you use your character’s
“Animal Empathy” skill to assess its hostility.
following the action process, The Simple Target
Number is 4 your character has 2 points in animal
empathy which gives her a modifier of +1
and 2d, the Skilled Target Number is 5. You roll
a 2 and a 1 for a final roll of 3. Subtract 3 from 5
to find Your character’s Degree of Success: 5 - 3
= 2, which is enough for your character to know
that the dog is happy, but has most likely lost its
owner.</p>
<p>
Critical Success, Critical Failure</p>
<p>
A Critical Success happens when all dice in a roll
set are 1. The more dice you roll, the more often
your character will succeed, but the harder it will
be for your character to get a Critical Success. A
Critical Success means the action succeeds and
has a better than expected result. The more
dice in a set, the more amazing a critical will be.
The Game Master has the honor of determining
what “amazing” looks like, and what events will
be triggered because of a critical success.
Conversely, a Critical Failure happens when all
dice in a roll set are 6. When you roll more dice
your character will fail less often; therefore, it
will become less likely that your character will
critically fail. A Critical Failure has worse than
expected results. The more dice in a rolled set,
the more dangerous the Critical Fail will be. The
Game Master has the misfortune of determining
what “danger” will befall the player group, and
what events will be triggered because of a critical
fail.</p>
<p>
Automatic Success</p>
<p>
There are a lot of actions that characters will take
that are trivial or common sense. These do not
require a roll and are counted as automatically
succeeding. The only time these will need a roll
are when there are adverse conditions (weather,
battle, impeding injury, etc.) or when the Game
Master says.</p>
<p>
Walking in a straight line on a summer day would
have no roll. Attempting to walk in a straight line
on sheet ice during a snow storm would require
a roll to keep footing and a roll to maintain the
correct direction of travel.</p>
<p>
Disposition</p>
<p>
The sum of a character’s Attributes, Health, Oddities,
and Skills, is referred to as their Disposition.
A character’s Disposition is tendency to act in a
specific way. Much like the real world, a character’s
skill set, demeanor, and overall health oftentimes
shines through in their personality. This
can be said as generalizations for groups, communities,
and nations as well.</p>
<p>
• Attributes are the core of a character. They
greatly influence everything about the character.
The base Attributes are averaged into
secondary Attributes and converted into modifiers
through a personal/skill modifier table
to make Skill creation and use easier, as well
as to more accurately reflect the nature of
attributes as a complex system.</p>
<p>
• Health Meter is the sum of a character’s
Mental, Physical, and Spiritual health. The
healthiest characters have nothing checked
or marked in these boxes.</p>
<p>
• Oddities are traits that are taken at character
creation and provide a defining factor
in a character’s strengths and weaknesses,
while also providing fuel for creative roleplay.
Oddities have a permanent passive effect on
the character; they may boost skill sets, but
may come at a cost of Health detriments (or
the other way around).</p>
<p>
• Skills are learned abilities that a character
possesses. These are what a character knows
how to do.</p>
<p>Character Creation</p>
<p>It is great to sit down to play a game with well written
characters. It is even better when
the character’s attributes and abilities are reflected
in the story. Many players and game
masters take pride in designing the characters
and adventures they play, from the environment
and backstory to appearance, to
attitude and social disposition. They create
interesting characters with compelling and
intriguing lives. In these stories the characters
are center stage and the Game Master
is the guide.</p>
<p>
Starting Points</p>
<p>
Every character, whether it is the Player or NPC,
has starting points. These are the points that you
will spend on Oddities and Skills. In order to be
ready for the game, the sum of the points spent
on Oddities and the character’s Skills points must
equal the sum of the Starting primary attribute
Points for your character. The ability to sum and
balance the character sheet is one feature that
lends itself to translating the CCARPS system
into other forms of media such as video games. A
character’s starting points are equal to the sum
of the character’s primary attributes.</p>
<p>
Starting Age</p>
<p>
Starting Age is used to help add variety to the
group’s characters, where physical growth and
past experience are taken into account. A character’s
starting age adds depth and a sense of
connection between the character, their past, and
their place in the game world. The first step
in character creation is to choose the character’s
starting age. Second step is to find the character’s
starting age on the Starting Age Table to determine
how many dice to roll for each attribute.</p>
<p>
Figure 1: Starting Age in Years</p>
<p>
The third step is rolling your character’s Primary
Attributes. In general players roll five sets of
dice according to the Starting Age Table and
record each set in one of the primary attribute
boxes. The primary attributes each have two
boxes associated with them. The Accumulator
box, and the Points box. The Accumulator box
is used for storing adventure points during game
play and is labeled Acc. see Improving Your
Character for more information. The Points box,
labeled Pts., is used to record the initial values
for the character’s primary attributes.</p>
<p>
Character Rank</p>
<p>
Character rank is the sum of the character’s Primary
Attributes. After the player has rolled the
character’s primary attributes he or she willl sum
all of the primary attributes together and use
this table to determine the starting rank of their
character.</p>
<p>
• Beginner: 75 points</p>
<p>
• Novice: 90 points</p>
<p>
• Advanced: 105 points</p>
<p>
• Heroic: 120 points</p>
<p>
• Epic: 135 points</p>
<p>
• Legendary: 150 points</p>
<p>
Game Master Note: If you want to boost characters
rank, have the players roll extra dice sets
to replace lower rolls, or have players re-roll all
ones when rolling primary attributes to increase
the total value for attribute points. Alternatively,
the Game Master can assign a number of points
that the player may distribute to boost their stats
to more closely match the rank required by the
adventure. See Character Creation Conventions
at the end of this section for alternate methods of
rolling up characters.</p>
<p>
Primary Attributes</p>
<p>
CCARPS characters have five Primary Attributes:</p>
<p>
• Strength (S): Capability of producing
and/or withstanding great physical force.</p>
<p>
• Dexterity (D): Skill in performing tasks,
especially with the hands.</p>
<p>
• Constitution (C): A person’s physique or
temperament; the general health of a person.</p>
<p>
• Intelligence (I): The faculty of thinking,
judging, abstract reasoning, and conceptual
understanding.</p>
<p>
• Willpower (W): The unwavering strength
of will (intention, desire) to carry out one’s
wishes.</p>
<p>
Secondary Attributes</p>
<p>
The secondary attributes are average combinations
of the primary attributes. Once the secondary
attribute base is calculated use the skill
modifier table to determine the secondary attribute
modifier. Skills are based on secondary
attributes as are any action rolls where a character
does not have a related skill.</p>
<p>
Unskilled Action Rule Unskilled action rolls
always use 2d, are limited to simple actions, are
immune to critical success and failure, and are
subject to all situational modifiers. Characters
may not use the unskilled action rule to perform
complex actions. A Complex Action is any action
that is composed of two or more simple actions.
Complex Action example: firing an arrow from
a bow; knock an arrow, draw, aim, and release.
This would require 4 separate dice rolls under the
unskilled action rule, one for each of the simple
actions. To successfully fire the arrow, the character
would have to succeed on all of the rolls in
succession for the simple action steps to complete
the complex action required to fire a bow. A failed
roll would cause the character to start the whole
process over from the beginning.</p>
<p>
• Charisma (CHA): Personal charm or magnetism,
as determined by the health, and will
of the character. Average of Willpower and
Constitution. (W + C) / 2</p>
<p>
• Speed (SPD): The rate of motion or athletic
action. Average of Strength and Dexterity.
(S + D) / 2</p>
<p>
• Reflex (RFX): An automatic response to
stimulus which does not require mental processing.
Average of Dexterity, and Intelligence.
(D + I) / 2</p>
<p>
• Lift (LFT): To exert the strength for raising
or bearing. Average of Constitution and
Strength. (C + S) / 2</p>
<p>
• Perception (PER): Conscious understanding
of something; to be aware of. Average of
Intelligence and Willpower. (I + W) / 2</p>
<p>
Oddities</p>
<p>
Oddities may only be taken at character creation.
Oddities are used to gain advantages and to make
trade off’s to provide flexibility and role-play interest
in character options, in other words, Oddities
add “character” to your characters. Your Game
Master may modify a character’s Oddities based
on role-play events or extraordinary situations.
Oddities may make permanent Health changes</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>
based on the description of the oddity, or Game
Master’s discretion.</p>
<p>
The general rule with Oddities is that each Oddity
must have a balanced cost and benefit. Some
oddities have a positive effect and cost points,
while others have a negative effect and give points.
Use your best judgement when selecting oddities
for your character, but be reasonable a character
with too many oddities or conflicting oddities can
be difficult or impossible to role-play accurately.
Basic Oddities</p>
<p>
During character creation, there are two Oddities
that are reccomended. These are Wealth and
Social Influence. There are no Modifiers with
these; instead, they help give characters some
“roots” into the game world. If no Wealth or
Social Influence is taken, it is assumed they are
Middle Class with no contacts out of the ordinary.
Wealth is a measure of a character’s accumulation
of material value, including things such as
property (home, car, horses), finery (cloths, tools,
weapons), etc. and defines the character’s starting
currency according to the Wealth Table. The
points spent or given are meant to represent the
character’s perception of wealth and their ability
to move in social circles. A person raised with
a filthy rich lifestyle would stand out like a sore
thumb on skid row, just as a dirt poor person
would at a country club.</p>
<p>
Figure 2: Wealth and Standing</p>
<p>
Social Influence is measured by the number of
people you have in your contact list, and the quality
of the contact relationship eg. An Acquaintance
(a low quality contact) will accept your call
and listen to your request, they may even provide
information if asked the right question but the
information has a 50% chance of being inaccurate.
A Friend (an average contact) is like a good
friend, you can trust them to tell you what they
know but they have limited access to high level
information, and generally will not get into harms
way for you. A Confidant (a high quality contact)
will have good access to information and be trustworthy
and reliable and will defend you at his or
her own risk up to but not including risk of his or
her own life. Conversely you can choose contacts
that are detramental to your character. eg. the
Antagonist is most often hyper competative in
all your dealings and may even enjoy seeing your
character struggle through a problem they coaxed
or goaded your character into. A Nemesis will
actively seek ways to interfere with your character
and their dealings up to but not limited to
setting you up for a major setback or even your
hapenstance death. An Arch-Nemesis is the most
dangerous type of contact the Arch-nemesis will
actively plot your character’s demise often in the
most diabolical way. At character creation your
character can take a maximum of three contacts
and your character cannot spend or receive more
than 15 points in total unless the Game Master
says otherwise.</p>
<p>
• -15 points: Arch-nemesis</p>
<p>
• -10 points: Nemesis</p>
<p>
• -5 points: Antagonist</p>
<p>
• 0 points: No-one out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>
• 5 points: Acquaintance</p>
<p>
• 10 points: Friend</p>
<p>
• 15 points: Confidant</p>
<p>
Speach Impediment</p>

Studder, Mute, Cluttering (speaks too fast,
often running words together.) </p>
<p>* -50 points: Extreme

to damage </p>
<p>* 5 points: Ignore the first 1 point of
Mental modifiers due to damage</p>
<p>
Player Note Further oddities can be found in the
world content framework, and in the world content
for the adventure you are playing.</p>
<p>
Skills</p>
<p>
Skills determine what your character can do as
well as what they know. Adding one point to a
skill is the equivalent of the character experimenting
with new ideas, or reading a basic instruction
manual, or taking an introductory lesson from
one who knows the skill at an advanced level or
higher. This gives the character the ability to use
the skill to perform a complex action with a single
die roll.</p>
<p> Using a skill to perform a Complex Action.
example: firing an arrow from a bow; knock
an arrow, draw, aim, and release. one point in
Archery skill would alow the character to make
one roll to determine the result of the four simple
acctions required to fire an arrow.</p>
<p>
/// Each skill has an Attribute associated with it.
These attributes are skill requirements; at character
creation no skill may have points that are
greater than the associated attribute modifier.
For example, if your Charisma Modifier is +2,
you cannot have more than 2 points in your Intimidate
skill at character creation.///
Before a character can attempt to use a skill they
must apply at least one point to it for it to be
useful. To use a skill without any proficiency see
Unskilled Action rule under Secondary Attribute
section.</p>

Character Creation Conventions</p>
<p>
The conventions used to roll up characters for your
adventure will influence the feel of the adventure.
Some methods are more Hard Core than others
while some are down right campy. None of the
methods you choose are necessarily bad or good
just different. CCARPS is designed to be adaptive
so that it can naturally support whatever style
you and your group wish to play. We would like
to provide some examples for you to think about,
these are not to be considered an extensive list
and by no means exhaustive.</p>
<p>
• Hard Core: this method will generally create
characters that will require many hours
to build and is not recommended for the faint
of heart. For your Hard Core roll play, roll
your dice according to your age chart and
record them in the order they are rolled directly
onto the character sheet. First roll =
Strength, second = Dexterity, third = Constitution,
fourth = Intelligence, and fifth =
Wisdom. No re-rolls; limit the number of
Oddities to five and require the sum of all
oddities to = 0; limit the maximum starting
skill points for any one skill to the associated
Attribute’s modifier.</p>
<p>
• Fantasy: this method will create characters
that are moderately easy to play. It
is a good choice if you like a serious story
Figure 3: Modifier Table but moderately challenging 
game play. For Fantasy style, roll five sets of dice according
to the Age Table, and record them on the
back of your character sheet. Assign each set
according to your preference for the type of
character you wish to play. Limit the number
of Oddities to seven and the maximum starting
skill points to two times the associated
Attribute’s modifier.</p>
<p>
• Campy: this method is a great way to play
a quick game loaded with silliness and amazingly
funny antics, but is not a good campaign
setting, as normally the rewards are
handed out liberally to support the entertainment
value for the players. For a campy
game, roll 10 sets of dice according to the
Age Table, re-rolling all ones. Record your
best five sets in any order you choose. Limit
the number of Oddities to the system maximum
of ten. There is no limit on starting
skill points.</p>
<p>
Wealth and Influence count as Oddities so they
will each take up a slot if they are taken. If they
are not taken wealth will only be used to determine
your starting currency, and Social influence
will have no effect on your character.</p>
<p>
Character Appearance</p>
<p>
The appearance of a given character is generally
up to the player. However, it is a good idea to
use character Attributes, Oddities, and Skills as
guidelines. The range of possible values in a base
Attribute is 5 to 30 for an adult character (21 years
or older). Just as a person with an Intelligence of
5 would be seen as an imbecile, a person with 5 in
Charisma would be a rather unlikeable fellow. It
would be unusual for a character who is perceived
to be strong to have low Strength. It should be
noted that CCARPS characters range the average
Human height: from 4 feet 6 inches to 7 feet. Any
other heights are up to the Game Master.</p>
<p>
Character Background</p>
<p>
This is pretty much open to player creativity.
Background story can go a long way toward identifying
a character’s habits of mind, body, and
spirit. This can aid the player in making good
believable decisions and greatly enhance the role
play experience as well as add to the group dynamics
so put some thought into this part. Take
this opportunity to be creative and make your
character interesting. The character’s Disposition
is a great thing to keep in mind when writing
their story. See Disposition section for more information.
Also you may want to give some thought
to the world your character exists in, this will
help you to fit in and guide you in role playing
your character.</p>
<p>
Improving Your Character</p>
<p>
Points are earned through adventuring. As a general
rule, each player should earn an average of
between 10-15 points per session that they actively
roleplay. Commonly points can be earned by: performing
an action that directly furthers the plot;
rolling a Critical Success on a plot-related action;
performing an action that helps the group at great
risk to self; remaining in character when there is
a great pressure to break the fourth wall, etc. It
is up to the Game Master, how many points each
character receives, and when. Character teams
that work together to deliberately coordinate their
actions to further the plot (without having hints
given by the Game Master) generally obtain more
points than ones that are always squabbling.</p>
<p>
Point Assignment</p>
<p>
Points must be assigned within the session they
are given; points cannot be stored up. At the
beginning of any session where a character has
unassigned points, those points must be assigned
to a Skill or into an Attribute accumulator before
play begins.</p>
<p>
Once points are assigned to a skill they may not
be moved or re-assigned. Skills are increased
by adding points to them. Modifier bonuses are
gained according to the Modifier Table (see Modifier
Table ). The maximum points a Skill can have
is 36. New Skills can be learned through a trainer,
reading the appropriate book, or similar learning
adventures. Even when learning a new Skill this
way, one must use the points given during that
session. </p>
<p>For example:
Bob the Bouncer wants to add a combat skill to
gain a block/parry advantage for when he has to
confront unruly people. At the end of the session,
Bob has earned 3 points; he either locates
a trainer or self-teaches by reading a book. The
player writes the skill name into the skill list, applies
all three points he has earned to the new
Skill, locates and records the modifier and dice
for a skill with 3 points.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Combat is
represented as a series of actions. All actions are
rosolved throught skill tests. Each action has a
base Target Number that is determined by a difficulty
table. The base target number is modified
by the Game Master for Sutuational Difficulty,
the active Player for Character Skill Modifiers,
and the opponent for Defensive Skill Modifiers.</p>
<p>
• Situational modifiers can be positive or negative
depending on the current conditions.</p>
<p>
• Active Skill modifiers are always positive.</p>
<p>
• Defensive Skill modifiers are always negative.</p>
<p>
The combat sequence is as follows:</p>
<p>
• Active Character Initiates combat by describing
their intended action.</p>
<p>
• Game Master determines the base target
number and applies the situational modifiers.</p>
<p>
• Opposing Character subtracts his or her reflex
modifier and defencive skill modifiers.</p>
<p>
• Active Character makes a skill test and subtracts
his or her skill modifiers and weapon</p>
<p>
attack Modifiers.</p>
<p>
• Upon success, the Active Character sums the
weapon damage and any damage Modifiers.</p>
<p>
• Active Character reports the number and
damage type to the Opposing Character.</p>
<p>
• The Opposing Character subtracts their appropriate
resistances from the damage.</p>
<p>
• The Opposing Character records the damage
in the related damage type box.</p>
<p>
If the damage is below one, no marking is done.
See Damage Overload below if damage exceeds the
number of available boxes.</p>
<p>
If the attack roll was a Critical Success the final
damage staging number is doubled. Critical Failure
may result in the attackar harming self or any
friend nearby (at Game Master’s discretion).</p>
<p>
Range and Reach Modifiers</p>
<p>
Range and Reach are how far a character can
use projectiles or hit with melee weapons. Each
weapon has its own range or reach, and will have
the distance number and units listed for each section:
Short, Medium, Long, Extreme. These are
represented in the character sheet in the weapon
section as S, M, L, E.</p>
<p>
Combat Modifiers</p>
<p>
Combat Modifiers are degrees of difficulty when
using projectiles or hitting with melee weapons.
These help appropriately change the base Target
Number into something more fitting to the
situation. The harder the action, the lower the
Modifier. Some things, such as aiming or charging
toward an enemy may normally gain a bonus
Modifier, instead.</p>
<p>
General</p>
<p>
• Character is making a Called Shot: -4</p>
<p>
• Character is concentrating before attack: cumulative
+1 per turn, up to three turns. This
includes aiming, meditation, and other mental
and perception preparations.</p>
<p>
• Character is wounded: Already applies to
everything, since Health Meter Modifiers are
global to the character</p>
<p>
• Character’s weapon has longer reach: Modifier
is difference in Reach</p>
<p>
• Character only needs to make contact, not
necessarily inflict damage: +2</p>
<p>
• Character is attacking multiple targets: -1
per target</p>
<p>
• Visibility is obstructed: Depends on the situation(?)
Ranged</p>
<p>
• Character is running while attacking: -2 to
-4, depending on situation</p>
<p>
• Character is in melee combat: -3</p>
<p>
• Character is shooting from cover: -1 to -3
depending on type of cover(?)</p>
<p>
• Character is shooting blindly: -6</p>
<p>
• Target has partial cover: -1 to -3 depending
on amount of cover
Melee</p>
<p>
• Character is charging into attack: +2</p>
<p>
• Character has the superior position: +2</p>
<p>
• Target is prone: +3</p>
<p>
Damage</p>
<p>
The damage system is based on the ancient
Greek’s beliefs regarding human existence, where
a person was measured by the strength and health
of their mind, body, and spirit. The optimal case
would be to have all three in equal amounts such
that they could be represented by an equilateral
triangle: Mental -> Physical -> Spiritual ->
Mental. Dealing and taking damage is handled
through a series of check boxes. There are ten
boxes for each of the three types of health. Damage
is counted by checking a number of boxes
equal to the amount of damage dealt starting at
the damage level noted by the weapon’s damage
type and rating, and all boxes below that level.
If a character has already taken damage beyond
the indicated level, the new damage is counted by
checking off boxes on the next available damage
type until all the damage is applied. Damage
levels are Light, Moderate, Heavy, and Deadly.
In CCARPS damage comes in three forms; Mental,
Physical, and Spiritual.</p>
<p>
Damage is represented as a series of three connected
bars of ten boxes each. Box ten on the
Mental bar is connected to box one on the Physical
bar, and box ten on the Physical bar is connected
to box one on the Spiritual bar. The tenth box of
Spiritual is connected to box one of the Mental
bar.</p>
<p>
Damage overload occurs when the normal damage
bar for the given damage index is full, and
more damage of the same type is dealt to a character.
The overload damage is then applied to
the next damage meter. When a character fills
an entire damage bar, that character will lose
consciousness.</p>
<p>
Once a character is unconscious, the player must
roll 2d against their Charisma Modifier as their
Basic Target Number. On a failure, the character
takes 1 point of damage, following the order of
damage overload. A character is permanently
dead when all three bars are filled completely.
Any character that has two bars of damage filled,
they cannot be revived without intervention of a
trauma surgeon (or other world and/or campaignspecific
skills).</p>
<p>
Damage types include Stun, Shock, Bludgeon,
Cutting, Piercing, and Energy (some worlds call
this “magic”).</p>
<p>
Mental</p>
<p>
Mental Health is the overall well-being of a character’s
mental state. Mental damage can be caused
by a variety of things, from a punch to the face to
a flash bomb or electrocution. Spiritual damage
overflows into Mental Health.</p>
<p>
Physical</p>
<p>
Physical damage comes primarily from physical
attacks, but can also be caused by Mental Health
overload.</p>
<p>
Spiritual</p>
<p>
Spiritual damage is primarily caused by attacks of
wit (interrogation, debate, etc.), but can also come
from energy-based (or magical) attacks. Physical
Health damage overflows into spiritual health.</p>
<p>
Damage Levels</p>
<p>
Damage is represented by three sets of ten boxes.
Each damage type (as mentioned above) has
its own Damage Meter Bar. Damage levels are
separated into Light, Moderate, Serious, and
Deadly. When a character reaches the first box
on a given meter, that character will take a -1
penalty to all Target Numbers. At the third box
the character takes a -2 to all Target Numbers.
At the sixth box the character takes a -3 to all
target numbers.</p>
<p>
These penalties are cumulative. If a character has
registered three physical and six mental damage
the total penalty will be -1 + -2 + -3 for the
mental damage plus -1 + -2 for a total penalty of
-9. These penalties will remain until the damage
is healed below the given level.</p>
<p>
Figure 4: Damage Meter Bar</p>
<p>
Collateral Damage</p>
<p>
In the case that a player misses an attack, the
Game Master rolls to hit all logically available
targets, once for each possible target.</p>
<p>
Figure 5: Collateral Damage</p>
<p>
Damage Recovery</p>
<p>
Mental Health heals over time;</p>
<p>
Physical Health heals with medical attention; </p>
<p>
Spiritual Health requires an act of faith, affirmation, or some other
type of belief, to heal.</p>
<p>
/// Mental Health recovery time is equal to 10 minutes
times the number of damage boxes checked
in all three damage indicators. A character with
5 boxes of Mental, 2 box of Physical, and 1 box of
Spiritual, marked. 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. 8 * 10 minutes
= 80 minutes. After that time, or whenever the
Game Master says (in the event they speed time
up), all Mental Health boxes are cleared.
MH Recovery = 10 * # damage boxes filled
Physical Health can be recovered by the application
of first aid for up to 3 boxes (first aid can
only be used once for each wound, A field medic
with a standard field medical kit, can heal up to
6 boxes once for each wound. The character can
to be treated by a doctor in a hospital or medical
clinic to heal up to 10 boxes. In any case, the
recovery time is 10 hours times the initial number
of damage boxes checked in all three damage indicators,
divided by the Tech Level of the character
rendering aid.
Spiritual Health is the most difficult to regain.
Each point of Spiritual damage marked will require
a number of hours spent in the act of
meditating, praying, or otherwise feeding the
soul/spirit to heal. The amount of time is equal
to 10 hours times the number of Spiritual Health
boxes marked. The spiritual rebuilding exercise
must be coordinated through the Game Master
and must be in accordance with the character’s
stated belief system.///</p>
<p>
Hit Location Chart</p>
<p>
When a player designates a target and launches a
projectile, the player must roll below the modified
target number in order to hit. If the player rolls
above the target number the projectile completely
misses.</p>
<p>
Figure 6: Hit Locations</p>
<p>
Shot from the Hip</p>
<p>
In the case of a hit without a called shot, the gm
rolls two hit dice to determine where the projectile
hits the target. (See hit location chart.)</p>
<p>
Called Shot Miss</p>
<p>
When a player designates an area to hit on a
target, the player must roll below the modified
target number to hit. if the player’s roll is equal
to or greater than the modified target number the
players shot will miss. As you may have guessed,
this is where Sir Issaic Newton’s first law comes
in: “An object in motion tends to stay in motion”,
etc. etc. so that thing; fist, arrow, bullet must go
somewhere. The following chart and 1d6 will help
you figure out what force will cancel the motion
of the object.</p>
<p>
Imagine a circle cut into 6 slices overlaid on the
target with its center point on the called location.
Now roll 1d and count the pie slices clockwise from
the top to determine which direction the miss
took. </p>
<p>Newton’s Second Law is “the relationship
Force equals mass times acceleration (F = m * a).
Use the difference between the Modified Target
Number and the player’s roll to determine the
magnitude. Then, let Sir Isaac prove his stuff by
knocking the F out of the projectile, and into the
unintended location. The creativity gets going
when applying Newton’s Third Law:”To every
action there is always opposed an equal reaction."</p>
<p>
Critical Fail Wheel</p>
<p>
In the case of a Critical Fail, we have a Critical
Fail Wheel. The Active Character is in the
middle of the wheel (as shown below) and any
nearby characters, both friendly and enemy, will
fall within a certain number. The Active Character
rolls 2d, with the sum being the direction
in which their action went. This works for both
ranged and melee combat.</p>
<p>
Figure 7: Critical Fail Wheel</p>
<p>
Height-based Modifiers</p>
<p>
Height modifiers are calculated by taking the
Opposing Character’s Height (rounded) in feet
and subtracting the Active Character’s height
(rounded) in feet. For example, if the Active
Character is 7 feet tall and the Opposing Character
is 3, the Active Character will have a -4
Modifier to hit and a +4 Modifier to damage.
However, when the Opposing Character becomes
Active, they will have a +4 Modifier to hit and
a -4 Modifier to damage. This helps prevent giant
characters from always being able to hit tiny
characters as if they were equal in height.</p>
<p>
Figure 8: Target Size Chart</p>
<p>
Dodge, Block, Parry</p>
<p>
• *Defender’s Rule:</p>
<p>
• Dodge is to evade an attack avoiding all damage
on success.</p>
<p>
• Trade off:* defender must forgo any actions
including simple actions until defenders next
turn.</p>
<p>
•
• Block is to absorb an attack with an object
other than the intended target of a given
attack</p>
<p>
• -4 to repose attack and -2 damage on success.</p>
<p>
• Parry is to deflect an attack by exerting a
complementary force to move the impact to
a more favorable location</p>
<p>
• +2 to repose attack, requires an armed melee
skill, cannot use called shot.</p>
<p> Movement </p>
<p>
Base Movement Target Numbers
Under non-stressful situations, walking generally
doesn’t require a roll. This is a base Modifier
Table for reference when a character has impediments,
such as high encumberance, stress, or
during extended combat.</p>
<p>
Figure 9: Basic Movement Target Numbers</p>
<p>
Encumberance</p>
<p>
Player characters can carry mass equal to 10 times
their Lift modifier. Every pound over the maximum
adds -1 to all physical actions. When a character’s
Encumberance Modifer brings the overall
action Modifier below 0, that character must roll
to succeed on simple actions such as walking upright,
turning around, stopping quickly, etc.
Armor also affects freedom of movement, depending
on armor type and class.</p>
<p>
Disposition</p>
<p>
A character’s Disposition is the sum of their
character sheet. Oddities make up the largest
and most lasting permanent changes to a character;
they give permanent bonuses and detriments.
They are the only part of character creation that
can modify any aspect of a character, including
(especially) Attributes, Resistances, and the
Health Meter.</p>
<p>
Base Odditites</p>
<p>
Militaristic: </p>
<p>“Might makes right” is the motto.
The character has an ideology that the military is
the foundation of a society’s security, thus being
the most important aspect.</p>
<p>
Figure 10: Disposition Map</p>
<p>
Opportunistic: </p>
<p>The practice of taking advantage
of any situations or people to achieve an
end, often with no regard for principles or consequences.
Despotic: Government by a singular authority,
either a single person or tight-knit group, which
rules with absolute power, especially in a cruel
and oppressive way.</p>
<p>
Pacifistic:</p>
<p> The doctrine that disputes (especially
between countries) should be settled without recourse
to violence.</p>
<p>
Heroic/Just: </p>
<p>Regard for others, both natural
and moral without regard for oneself; devotion to
the interests of others; brotherly kindness; selflessness;
contrasted with egoism or selfishness.</p>
<p>
Libertine: </p>
<p>One who is freethinking in all matters.</p>
<p>
Neutral: </p>
<p>Neither beneficial nor harmful; this is
the default state of all characters.</p>

<p>
Technology Levels</p>
<p>
A character’s technology level helps define level
adjustments and target numbers when interacting
with any technology, from a basic tool (like a
club or lever) to a super computer on an interdimensional
time machine.</p>
<p>
Use the list below to determine target numbers.
A general rule is to add the tech level difference to
the target number if the technology is at a lower
level than the character’s tech level and subtract
from the target number if the technology is at a
higher level.</p>
<p>
